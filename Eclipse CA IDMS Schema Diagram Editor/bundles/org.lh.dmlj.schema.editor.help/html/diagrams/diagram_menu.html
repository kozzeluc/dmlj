<h1>Diagram Menu</h1>
When you have opened a diagram in the diagram editor, you will notice that a <i>Diagram menu</i> becomes available:
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/diagram_menu.png" alt="[diagram menu]">
<br><br>
The <i>Copy to clipboard</i> menu item does what it says: it copies the open diagram to the clipboard <i>as an image</i>; doing
so allows you to subsequently <i>paste</i> the image in your favorite graphics program (Paint, Preview, ...). This can be of 
help if you want to copy some parts of a diagram in a document for example, or - in the case of big diagrams - this can be an 
alternative to <a href="print_diagram.html">printing</a> the diagram, because directly printing large diagrams can be challenging.
<br><br>
For older people (like myself), the <i>Zoom</i> menu items can be of interest. Beware that the zoom percentage is <i>saved</i> 
as a diagram attribute. The zoom percentage is also visible and adjustable on the 
<a href="main_toolbar.html">Eclipse main toolbar</a>.
