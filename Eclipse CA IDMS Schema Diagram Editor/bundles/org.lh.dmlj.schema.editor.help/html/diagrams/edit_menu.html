<h1>Edit Menu</h1>
The menu items of interest in the Edit Menu are the ones related to the <i>undo/redo</i> functions :  like in many other editing 
programs, every action you take on a diagram is (temporarily) <i>recorded</i> and you are able to <i>undo</i> the last action(s) 
you did, as well as <i>redo</i> them if you want to.  So, if an accident happens, you will be able to recover your work and you 
don't lose the things you have been working on for hours.

Note that the diagram editor is so kind to show you <i>what</i> you can undo or redo.
