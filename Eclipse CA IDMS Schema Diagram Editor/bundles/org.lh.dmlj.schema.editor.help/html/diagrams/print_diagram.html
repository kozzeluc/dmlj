<h1>Printing Diagrams</h1>
You can print an opened diagram via the <i>Print menu</i> :
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/print_menu_item.png" alt="[print menu item]">
<br><br>
Beware that printing large diagrams can be <i>challenging</i>; products like PDF Creator can be of help here.  Something that can 
also work (for big diagrams) is <a href="diagram_menu.html">copying the diagram to the clipboard</a> and <i>pasting</i> it (as an 
image) in your favorite <i>image editor</i> (Paint, Preview, ...); this way you have the option of slicing up your diagram and 
printing it in parts.
