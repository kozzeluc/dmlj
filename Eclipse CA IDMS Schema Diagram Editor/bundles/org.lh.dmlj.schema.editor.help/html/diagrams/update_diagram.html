<h1>Updating Diagrams</h1>
To prevent you from having to create a new diagram when you have modified a schema in the IDMS dictionary, the diagram
editor provides an <b><i>update</i> feature</b>.  Just right-click on a diagram in the Package Explorer view to open the
Update wizard :
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/file_menu_update.png" alt="[file menu update]">
<br><br>
The Update wizard is actually very similar to the <a href="import_diagram.html#importwizard">Import wizard</a>; on the 
first page you'll need to check the source from which to update your diagram.  Select a source and confirm by pressing 
the <i>Select</i> button :
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/update_wizard_tool_selection.png" alt="[update wizard tool selection]">
<br><br>
The <i>Next</i> button will be <i>enabled</i> only after you have selected a source <i>and</i> confirmed your selection 
with the <i>Select</i> button.
<br><br>
The possible sources are the same as for the Import wizard :
<ul>
<li>An IDMS dictionary on your mainframe</li>
<li>A file that contains CA IDMS/DB schema syntax</li>
</ul>
If you have developed your own custom import functionality, (an)other source(s) will be listed as well.
<br><br> 
Mind the important <b>warning message</b> at the bottom of the wizard page :  if you're not using a version control 
system like GIT or Subversion, I strongly advise you to create a copy of your .schema or .schemadsl file <i>before</i> 
updating your diagram.  If something goes wrong while updating your diagram, you'll have something to revert to.  Have a
look at this 
<a href="https://kozzeluc.wordpress.com/2017/02/26/managing-diagram-versions-with-git/" target="_blank">blog post</a> to 
see how easy it is to start using GIT for your IDMS diagrams.
<br><br>
All remaining pages are the same as for the Import wizard, with the exception that <b>no record layout manager</b> has 
to be selected; any new records will be placed on the right side of your existing diagram.
