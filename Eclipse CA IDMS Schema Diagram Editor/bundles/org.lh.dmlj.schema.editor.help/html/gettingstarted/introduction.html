<h1>Introduction</h1>
The CA IDMS/DB Schema Diagram Editor is a free, open source and extensible diagram editor for 
CA IDMS/DB.
<br><br>
This graphical (GEF based) editor allows you to create (import) and maintain (update) diagrams for 
your existing CA IDMS/DB schemas. It is also capable of generating CA IDMS/DB schema syntax (export). 
And of course you can print your diagrams (or create PDF documents for them with PDFCreator).
<br><br>
This diagram editor is great for junior IDMS professionals to have an Eclipse based tool to explore 
IDMS and for senior IDMS specialists to have an IDMS-related tool to explore... Eclipse :-)
