<h1>Workbench</h1>
Assuming that you have the Java perspective active and have successfully opened the Properties 
view, your workbench should now look like this :
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/workbench.png" alt="[workbench]">
<br><br>
The four main areas of interest in the Eclipse workbench are :
<ol>
<li>The Package Explorer view : this view gives an overview of all projects in your workspace,
together with all their folders and files (just look at a project as a collection of folders and
files).</li>
<li>The editor area : for each diagram you open, a tab will appear in this area.</li>
<li>The Properties view : shows some useful information for the currently selected item in your
workbench (for instance the details for the record you have selected in one of your
diagrams).</li>
<li>The Outline view : displays a tree that illustrates the structure of the schema in the currently
open diagram editor; this view allows you to quickly locate a record or set in your diagram.</li>
</ol>
