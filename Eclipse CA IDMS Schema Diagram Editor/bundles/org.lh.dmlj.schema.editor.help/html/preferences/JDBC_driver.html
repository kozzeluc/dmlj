<h1>IDMS JDBC Driver</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The diagram editor can connect to your dictionaries in order to create diagrams for your existing schemas, provided that
you have installed the IDMS JDBC driver into the Eclipse workbench and have configured <b>IDMS Server</b> and an 
<b>application catalog</b> in at least 1 of your central versions.
<br><br>
You will have to find and download the IDMS JDBC driver yourself; it is a file called <b>idmsjdbc.jar</b>. Please note 
that this file needs to be transformed in a so-called <i>OSGI bundle</i> to make it suitable for use within Eclipse;
don't worry, the diagram editor can do this for you. Save the idmsjdbc.jar file somewhere on your workstation and then 
install it in your Eclipse workbench following the procedure described below.
<br><br>
Don't be intimidated by the steps necessary to install the JDBC driver because once this is done, there is no easier
way to generate diagrams for your schemas!
<h2>Installing the IDMS JDBC driver</h2>
Open the <a href="preferences_dialog.html">preferences dialog</a> and go to the diagram editor's Import/Dictionary/Driver 
section; since you have not yet  installed the driver, you will see the following:<br><br>
<img src="../../images/JDBC_driver_not_installed.png" alt="[JDBC driver not installed]">
<br><br>
Go up 1 level to the diagram editor's Import/Dictionary section and you will find a button labeled 
"Install Driver NOW...":
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/preferences_install_JDBC_driver.png" alt="[JDBC driver not installed]">
<br><br>
Press this button to start the installation of the IDMS JDBC driver in your Eclipse workbench:
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/preferences_JDBC_jar_file_selection.png" alt="[JDBC .jar file selection]">
<br><br>
Select the idmsjdbc.jar file on your workstation's file system using the button labeled "Select..."; then press the "OK"
button and you will notice that a button labeled "Please restart your workbench!" will appear; press that button:
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/preferences_restart_workbench.png" alt="[restart workbench]">
<br><br>
After your Eclipse workbench has restarted, open the <a href="preferences_dialog.html">preferences dialog</a> again and 
now you should see the IDMS JDBC driver version information for the file you installed:
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/JDBC_driver_installed.png" alt="[JDBC driver installed]">
<br><br>
When you see the version information, the JDBC driver was installed correctly. The driver version is retrieved from the
actual driver (the <code>javax.sql.Driver</code> implementation); the diagram editor just reports this version. The
provider plug-in information is taken from the <i>OSGI bundle</i> properties that were added to the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF 
file when importing the idmsjdbc.jar file.
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
Should the above procedure not work for you then you can try to install the IDMS JDBC driver into your Eclipse workbench
like so:
<ul>
<li>Stop your Eclipse workbench.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Edit the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</b> file in idmsjdbc.jar using a tool like 7-Zip (.jar files are like .zip files) 
and add the following lines to it:<br>
<code><pre>
Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
Bundle-Name: CA IDMS Server JDBC Driver
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.ca.idms.jdbc.driver
Bundle-Version: 17.1.4.0
Bundle-Vendor: Broadcom, Inc.
Export-Package: ca.idms.dsi,
 ca.idms.io,
 ca.idms.jdbc,
 ca.idms.net,
 ca.idms.proxy,
 ca.idms.qcli,
 ca.idms.util,
 ca.idms.xa,
 com.ca.idms.hibernate,
 com.ca.idms.was
Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: JavaSE-11
</pre></code>
Copy the version information from <code>Implementation-Version</code> to <code>Bundle-Version</code> and make sure to 
have an empty line after <code>Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: JavaSE-11</code>. Don't forget to save your work
(in the idmsjdbc.jar file).
<br><br>
You have just transformed the idmsjdbc.jar file to an <b>OSGI bundle</b> that is ready to be picked up by Eclipse.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>In your <b>Eclipse installation folder</b> (there is always a file called <i>eclipse.ini</i> in this folder as well 
as a <i>features</i> and a <i>plugins</i> folder, so hopefully this helps you in locating this folder on your PC's file
system), <b>create a folder called <i>dropins</i></b> if it not yet exists. On the Mac, the Eclipse installation folder 
is beneath your Applications folder; right-click on the Eclipse icon (in the Applications folder) and then select the <i>Show 
Package Contents</i> menu item:
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/Eclipse_application_context_menu.png" alt="[Eclipse application context menu]">
<br><br>
Then open the <i>Contents/Eclipse</i> folder, which is the folder you'll need to create the <b>dropins</b> folder in if
it isn't already there.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Copy your tweaked idmsjdbc.jar file</b> into the dropins folder.<br><br></li>
<li>Start your Eclipse workbench and check the IDMS JDBC driver's availability via the preferences dialog (see above).
</li>
</ul>
This is what happens behind the scenes when you install the IDMS JDBC driver via the diagram editor, so if something 
goes wrong there, you now know how to fix this yourself.
<br><br>
When replacing idmsjdbc.jar by a more recent version, it may be necessary to start Eclipse with the -clean command line
argument.
