<h1>Dictionaries</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the Eclipse <a href="preferences_dialog">preferences dialog</a> you can define 1 or more <i>dictionaries</i> that are 
used to import schema diagrams directly from IDMS application dictionaries on your mainframe(s) using SQL Web Connect 
(or the SQL Option) and IDMS Server.  Make sure you have installed the IDMS JDBC driver and set up the mainframe part
(i.e. an application dictionary with a catalog component and IDMS Server exposing this outside of your mainframe) before
defining dictionaries in Eclipse.  If you see the following message, first go ahead with the <a href="JDBC_driver.html">
installation of the JDBC driver</a> into your Eclipse workbench :

<br><br>
<i>Without</i> a backing application dictionary (<i>with</i> a catalog component) on a mainframe, the definition of a 
dictionary for the diagram editor in the preferences dialog is useless.
<br><br>
In your mainframe application dictionary/catalog, you need a <b>relational schema for IDMSNTWK</b>; the diagram editor 
will execute queries referring to this schema to retrieve the data it needs to generate diagrams.  Note that you can 
define <i>several</i> such (relational) schemas in the same catalog, each targeting a different dictionary (different 
dictionaries share the same structure, which is described in the IDMSNTWK schema).  In a freshly defined application 
catalog there is a schema called <b>SYSDICT</b>; you can use this schema if the non-relational schemas for which you 
want to generate diagrams are in the same dictionary.  If this is <i>not</i> the case, create (an)other relational 
schema(s) pointing to the dictionar(y)(ies) containing your non-relational schemas :

<h2>Defining a Dictionary</h2>
Open the the <b>Import/Dictionary section</b> in the <a href="preferences_dialog">preferences dialog</a>; there you have
an overview of the dictionaries you have defined :
<br><br>

<br><br>
Note the <i>SYSDIRL ?</i> column; you can mark dictionaries containing the IDMSNTWK schema so that you can generate a 
diagram for this schema should want to do this.  The buttons on the right of the table allow you to <b>add, remove or 
edit dictionary definitions</b> as well as <b>test</b> whether the connection (to the dictionary/catalog on your 
mainframe) works correctly.  You can also set the default name (SYSDICT) for the relational-version of the IDMSNTWK 
schema in this section.  You shouldn't touch the <b>magic number 47</b> unless you want to interfere with the 
performance of the diagram editor queries. 
<br><br>
Press the <i>Add...</i> button to create your first dictionary :
<br><br>

<br><br>
Most of the fields should be self-explaining by now.  Each dictionary needs an <b>identifier (id)</b>, so give your 
dictionary a meaningful name.  The <i>dictname</i> field maps to the <b>DBNAME</b> in your DBTABLE that includes the 
dictionary and catalog segments making up your dictionary/catalog.
<br><br>
You are not obliged to enter your <b>password</b> but beware that if you don't, the diagram editor will ask you for it 
whenever needed :  
<br><br>

<br><br>
If you do store your password, don't forget to change it in Eclipse when you have changed your 
mainframe password (you'll need to do this in <i>every</i> dictionary).  There is something to say for both approaches.
The password is stored in an encrypted format that can only be decrypted by the diagram editor on <i>your</i> machine.
If you ever get tired of entering your password, either modify the dictionary definition or check the option to store 
your password in the 'Password required' dialog above.
<br><br>
Press the <i>Test Connection</i> button to check whether the connection to your mainframe dictionary/catalog works.  You
will get an error message dialog if the connection failed :
<br><br>
<img src="../../images/dictionary_connection_not_successful.png" alt="[dictionary connection not successful]">
<br><br>
In the case the connection was successful you will be informed as well :
<br><br>
[TODO provide screenshot of connection successful informational message dialog]
<br><br>
Press the OK button to <b>save</b> the dictionary definition in your workspace.
