As of version 1.5.0
===================
- Changes can easily be tracked in the GIT repository (https://github.com/kozzeluc/dmlj); there is 
  NO need to duplicate things here any longer.


Version 1.4.0
=============
- Added functionality to add and delete indexes (palette contains new index icon).
- Rework the procedure class specifications in the model.
- Model change notification redesign.
- Correct OK button enablement for the "edit area specification" dialog.  Before, the user would  
  have to hit the enter key in either the new area or rename area text fields in order for the OK  
  button to become enabled; from now on, after releasing a key in either field will evaluate the  
  enabled status of the OK button.
- The user can now control every detail of a set's order; 2 hyperlinks were added in the Properties 
  view (general and sorted set property sections).
- Increased the width of the value column in attributes based property sections (Property View; 
  200 --> 300 pixels).
- Bug fix: an index is not selected in the outline view if the line that connects the index figure 
  with the record is selected in the diagram.  
- Bug fix: changing a record's location mode could result in "attribute owner is null" assertion 
  errors and have the CALC or VIA tab show up for DIRECT records.


Version 1.3.2
=============
- Added GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPL 3.0); no functionality added, modified or removed.


Version 1.3.1
=============
- Bug fix: could not drop a diagram label from the palette for schemas with no description (i.e. whose 
  description is null) due to a NPE while calculating the diagram label's initial size.
- Bug fix: export syntax - solved the issue with opening the exported syntax file when its name 
  contains 'illegal' characters like spaces (error message + the file was not opened).
- Bug fix: when the diagram label is selected together with at least 1 other item in the diagram,
  an assertion error would result ("only 1 diagram label expected" message; see workspace log).  The 
  user wouldn't have noticed though.
- Bug fix: after importing a schema and zooming in or out (without closing and reopening the file),
  the source and target connection points were not scaled correctly; this was due to the editor's
  setInput(...) method being called twice, causing a situation where 2 Schema objects were in 
  circulation.


Version 1.3.0
=============
- Implemented the Outline view synchronization. 
- Introduced the diagram label.
- Reorganized the property sections + new property section for areas + property section for the
  diagram label (description) + syntax section for schemas.
- New preferences: default diagram properties for new and imported schemas + organisation for the
  diagram label (main preference page).


Version 1.2.0
=============
- Reworked the IPdfExtractorService interface (org.lh.dmlj.schema.editor.Service.api v1.2.0): this
  kind of services now only have to extract content and metadata; all content and metadata
  interpretation is moved to the org.lh.dmlj.schema.editor (v1.2.0) plug-in.
- Support for CA IDMS/DB 18.5.00 documentation import.
- Included plug-in org.lh.dmlj.schema.editor.tika_1.4 (v1.2.0); this plug-in wraps Tika 1.4 and
  provides an IPdfExtractorService implementation.  This makes dictionary guide importation a-
  standard feature.  The Apache Licence Version 2.0 is included with this feature.
  Tika extracts the PDF bookmarks as of version 1.3; we don't need these, so we needed to modify
  the PDF extraction mechanism for this.
- The activator of the main plug-in provides a number of log methods; it also simulates a debug-
  level, which depends on the new preference setting 'logDiagnosticMessages', that should allow us
  to write debug-messages to the standard log.  Not much diagnostic messages are built-in now,
  (almost) only the schema import wizard writes some to the log.
- When importing from syntax, the record synonym name and version are now also extracted from the
  'USES STRUCTURE OF RECORD' clause if a 'SHARE STRUCTURE OF RECORD' clause is missing.
- The minimum root and fragment lengths are now ALWAYS requested from the selected import tool,
  i.e. regardless of the record's storage mode (before: only when the storage mode was not FIXED).
- The minimum root length can now exceed the record's data length (import wizard + properties view).
- The naming conventions for element names were softened: the element name must not exceed 32
  characters in length; what characters and the order in which they appear are no longer checked.
- The procedures used for compression (import) are now configurable and IDMSCOMP is no longer always
  considered as such a procedure.
- When exporting a schema, the generated syntax file is now opened in a text editor.
- BUG FIX: record and area procedure call specifications were not derived correctly when importing
  (or updating a schema).  The (2) methods of IRecordDataCollector<T> and IAreaDataCollector<T>
  other than the ones collecting the procedure names were refactored.
- BUG FIX: when exporting a schema, bad names were generated for the tree items in the tree showing
  all the workspace's .schema files (first export wizard page, the one with the message
  'Select the CA IDMS/DB Schema' - depending on the number and complexity of workspace projects, it
  takes (too) long before this page shows the schemas available for export).
- BUG FIX: when building the list of projects containing .schema files during an export, a NPE was
  thrown for projects not containing any .schema file.


Version 1.1.0
=============
- A diagram can now be printed.
- Removal of a schema diagram data's unit property - units have been pulled to the workspace level.
- Reviewed preferences; besides importing dictionary reference guides, the unit(s) can be set and 
  print margins (top/bottom/left/right, range 0 to 1 inch) can be specified; margins are stored in
  pels (logical pixels).
- The rulers in a diagram editor follow the configured units via a preference store listener.


Version 1.0.1
=============
- The calculation of element lengths has been drastically improved.


Version 1.0.0
=============
- First version.
