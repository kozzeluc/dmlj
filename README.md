Eclipse CA IDMSâ„¢/DB Schema Diagram Editor Repository


A free, open source and extensible diagram editor for CA IDMS/DB.

This graphical (GEF based) editor allows you to create (import) and 
maintain (update) diagrams for your existing CA IDMS/DB schemas. It 
is also capable of generating CA IDMS/DB schema syntax (export). 
And of course you can print your diagrams (or create PDF documents 
for them with PDFCreator).

This diagram editor is great for junior IDMS professionals to have 
an Eclipse based tool to explore IDMS and for senior IDMS 
specialists to have an IDMS-related tool to explore... Eclipse :-)
